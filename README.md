# Exploratory Data Cleaning and Analysis with python

This project focuses on a detailed analysis of a bank's customer data to predict customer conversion rate through different predictor variables.

## Aim
The main goal of this project is to identify patterns and relationships in the data that can help predict customer conversion rate. Extensive data cleaning was performed and univariate and bivariate analyzes were performed to better understand the variables and their impact on conversion.

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**: A deep cleaning of the data was carried out with pandas to guarantee the quality and consistency of the information.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: The variables were analyzed individually and in combination to identify patterns and relationships that influence conversion.
3. **Conclusions and Recommendations**: Recommendations were presented based on the observations of the exploratory data analysis to improve the customer conversion strategy.

## Content
1. CSV file with the data.
2. Jupyter notebooks with the code for data cleaning and exploratory analysis.

## Results
- Key predictor variables were identified that have a significant impact on customer conversion rates.
- An ideal client profile was proposed based on the findings of the exploratory data analysis.
